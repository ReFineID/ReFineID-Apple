  /// The cable-side debug surface: one type that owns every launch mode a
  /// Mac can drive this app with, so the app initializer stays a list of
  /// calls rather than a pile of flag tests.
  ///
  /// Every fix in the reference implementation came from an instrument, not
  /// from reasoning, and on iOS 26 there is no instrument left on the
  /// outside: `log stream --device` is gone, `log collect` fails, and an app
  /// extension's logging is invisible unless it writes somewhere the app can
  /// read. Without modes like these a failure on this device is
  /// indistinguishable from any other failure. Each mode prints to stdout,
  /// flushes, and exits with a status, so
  /// `xcrun devicectl device process launch --console` captures a whole run
  /// without one tap on the device.
  ///
  /// Two kinds of mode, and the difference is the scene:
  ///
  /// - ``DebugLaunchMode/diagnostics``, ``DebugLaunchMode/forgetCan``,
  ///   ``DebugLaunchMode/resetCardState``, ``DebugLaunchMode/setCan``,
  ///   ``DebugLaunchMode/setPin1`` and ``DebugLaunchMode/trace`` only read
  ///   or write this device's own state. They run from the app initializer, before any window exists,
  ///   and exit there.
  /// - ``DebugLaunchMode/prime`` needs a live scene: CoreNFC will not open
  ///   a slot for a process with no foreground window. It is handed to
  ///   ``DebugSceneRunnerView``, which runs it on appear and exits.
  ///
  /// Exit status is the contract: zero when the mode achieved what it was
  /// asked for, non-zero when it did not -- a priming run that stored the
  /// card but never registered it fails, and so does a `--trace` with
  /// nothing to print, because "the extension never ran" is the answer a
  /// script most needs to branch on.
  ///
  /// DEBUG ONLY. Every declaration in this file and in the types it names
  /// sits inside `#if DEBUG`, so a release build contains none of it: no
  /// flag parsing, no reset, and above all no way to write a credential
  /// from a command line.
  ///
  /// No mode prints a PIN, a card access number, a serial or a holder name.
  /// The two credential modes read their value from the command line at
  /// each launch -- a value is never committed, never defaulted, and never
  /// echoed back; only its length and whether the store accepted it.
